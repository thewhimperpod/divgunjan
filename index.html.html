         <div class="about_me">hi! i am divyansh gunjan from üìç patna, bihar, india. i am a student. i do other stuff as well, like desigining qc circuits, rocket test pads and recording podcasts. you can check those things out on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyanshgunjan/" target="_blank">linkedin</a>. you may not actively find me anywhere else. You can check out my <a href="https://twitter.com/divyanshgunjan" target="_blank">X</a> as well though.
        currently, i am a science student pursuing PCM at a local school in Patna as a non-attending individual. i will hopefully be attending college during fall of this year. no, i am not going to any IIT(i have been a pathetic test taker forever). Therefore, the United States it is for me. i will be consdering to pursue material sciences + engineering or aerospace engineering.
        I have been fascinated by space since the age of 9, when my father brought me a few encyclopediae/s. they were a NICE, quick read. recently a few materials like graphene and nitinol(idk anything about these) have caught my attention. why materials? just like every other naive believer, i believe they can change the world. How? 42. just kidding, too long for here.
        research is fun. what do i like? space. what do i not like? School(it's a torture). how will i do it? idk. why will i do it? because's it is the right thing to do. peace ‚úåÔ∏è
